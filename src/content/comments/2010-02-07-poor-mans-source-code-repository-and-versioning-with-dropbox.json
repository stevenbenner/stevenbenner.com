			"rendered": "<p>After much soul-searching and far too much digging into SVN documentation, I finally decided to give Dropbox a try for a poor man&#8217;s repository. I&#8217;ve been using it previously for a while now to sync and move files to and from work, but using it as a repository seems to be great so far as well.</p>\n<p>There are problems with SVN that just don&#8217;t seem to be gracefully solved as a Flash developer (primarily); specifically: handling the needed .fla binary files, some of which can grow to ~8-10MB in size depending on how much assets are in the library (all code is in separate source files); and also handling the additional external assets (XML files, images, etc) needed locally to recreate the server environment during building/debugging.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve got my &#8220;repository&#8221; set up just like you would with a real repository &#8212; trunk/branches/tags folders within each /client/project/ folder &#8212; as well as a simple &#8216;history.txt&#8217; file in the tags folder to track changes for each new &#8216;tag&#8217; I add.</p>\n<p>All on-going work is done in the trunk folder; all stable releases are frozen as duped copies in the tags folder, and tests etc are done as branches. Sure, there&#8217;s no merging, locking, or clearer history tools, but as a mostly-lone developer with very little overlap this is just fine.</p>\n<p>The best part is that so long as I keep my structure tidy, I should have very little problem moving to SVN in the future shall the need arise. Right now it&#8217;s overkill by a large margin, so Dropbox is just perfect in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Anyway, [ramble ramble ramble], thanks for the post.</p>\n"

I&#8217;ve never had any issues, DropBox updates are just so fast, it syncs small files in a second or less after saving. Files that I have been editing do build of a large history fairly quickly. But since the free version only keeps this history for 30 days it isn&#8217;t a big deal to me.</p>\n<p>If I had a subscription version of DropBox I might consider doing a check-in/check-out kind of system, but it probably wouldn&#8217;t be worth the effort (for me). It&#8217;s easy to spot a bunch of minor updates in a file&#8217;s history, because they usually happen over the course of a couple minutes.</p>\n<p>The files with the most updates are also the files that you care the least about, objects, pdb&#8217;s, dll&#8217;s and executable files. I can see the history on these becoming huge but you will probably not find much use for the history of those files.</p>\n<p>This system is one of the &#8220;just works&#8221; tools for me. I set it up and forget about it. I just wish they would give out permanent history with the free version. :)</p>\n"
