			"rendered": "<p>Like others have said, great post!</p>\n<p>The problem I face with trainingmobs.com is that virtually everything is user-specific. Users have other users following them, they in turn follow other users, each user could potentially get a different view of the main page depending on their interests, physical location, usage history with the site, local time, etc.</p>\n<p>Most of the caching work I have implemented so far is at the model level, using memcached and the excellent Multicache library (<a href=\"http://www.haughin.com/2007/10/09/codeigniter-multicache-library-01/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.haughin.com/2007/10/09/codeigniter-multicache-library-01/</a>) by Eliot Haughin.</p>\n<p>A model record is pulled out of the DB, turned into a row and then cached. Updates to that record (and updates to its relationships through many-to-many tables) cause cache invalidation. There is some more domain-specific considerations around this to squeeze every last bit of performance I can out of the most expensive operations, but thats the general idea.</p>\n<p>An interesting corollary of this is that it lets me use the config files to set TTLs for certain components on the page. So, for example, the most expensive operation on the site happens on the main page once a user logs in. I am willing to accept at most 5 minutes delay on new information shown to the user on this page, so I cache the entire output in memory (over and above caching the individual models that go into building this thing for a longer period of time). Since I control the logic of when and under what circumstances the cached records fall out of the in-memory cache, I can cache them for a day or whatever.</p>\n"
