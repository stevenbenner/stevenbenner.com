My mid-life career change.  I&#8217;ve had a couple of real breakthroughs lately, and in reading Meyer&#8217;s and others re: CSS reset, seemed as though I had better go along, because, well, two years of study and a couple of sites for local businesses&#8211;I&#8217;m not exactly in the big leagues&#8211;yet ;-D.</p>\n<p>But I kept asking myself, &#8220;Why am I adding all this?  Why not padding and margin at 0px&#8221;?</p>\n<p>And the work, time, tedium of adding *back* all the HTML default structure that was there in the first place&#8211;but I took it out so I could add  my CSS styles, to put it back in  most cases exactly as it would have been there&#8211;oh, and get very, very lost in a CSS labyrinth nightmare of my own creation????</p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t seem to make sense, but, hey, I&#8217;m new at this. </p>\n<p>Now, of course, I&#8217;m sure lots of people don&#8217;t agree and want to start with the proverbial clean slate.  Fine.  As you say,  there are cases  where resetting everything may be the way to go.  But as a regular practice?  Couldn&#8217;t really call that BEST practice, I think.</p>\n<p>Thanks, again, for the informative article, based on (yes, true) logic!</p>\n"
