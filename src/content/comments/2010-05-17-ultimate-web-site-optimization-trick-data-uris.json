			"rendered": "<p>But that&#8217;s the best part of data URIs! You can still use your sprites, except even more effectively. Data URIs enhance what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with sprites. I&#8217;ve taken to embedding my sprites into the CSS file, with a graceful degradation fallback to the standard sprite image on the server.</p>\n<p>So long as your server is properly configured for optimal caching then a CSS file will cache just as well as an image. With this technique there&#8217;s one less request for modern browsers.</p>\n<p>Maintainability is slightly reduced because you have to remember to update the CSS file whenever you update the sprite, but sprites themselves are a <em>huge</em> maintainability sacrifice. Since you have to keep a master composite image and append new images as needed. What&#8217;s even worse, if you need to remove one image then you also have to modify the CSS background-position for every image that follows it.</p>\n<p>But we&#8217;ve all accepted this as an acceptable trade off for the reduced number of HTTP connections. I think data URI&#8217;s are just one more little step in this direction.</p>\n"

This will greatly reduce the download size of the files and make the data URIs very efficient.</p>\n<p>For people running their own Apache server who don&#8217;t know the syntax, you enable gzip compression by enabling mod_deflate and adding the following line to your config file:</p>\n<p><code>AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/xml text/css application/x-javascript</code></p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember off hand how to do it in IIS but it is very simple, just google it.</p>\n"
