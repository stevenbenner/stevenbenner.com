When the user clicks a thumbnail, I wanted the larger version of the image to pop up in the horizontal and vertical center of the viewport. It works perfectly!!! I embedded your code in my own JavaScript and credited you in various places in the code. Thanks again! &#8211; Mike M.</p>\n"

Also we can detect the scroll bar sizes in IE also, but I will leave this for you to figure out.</p>\n"

			"rendered": "<p>You could use this code to set a wrapper div to the exact width and height of the browser view port, but that isn&#8217;t what I would recommend.</p>\n<p>The best way to support small screens is elastic design using nothing but CSS. There are many good tutorials out there on elastic design, but the technique is basically to use percentage and em measurements for the layout instead of pixels.</p>\n<p>If you really do need to be able to update some styles via JavaScript to fit the screen you can use the code from this article. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say that you want to adjust the width on a wrapper div, here&#8217;s what your document may look like:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n&lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;!-- your content here --&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Then this script will target the markup above and fit it to the screen:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nfunction fitWrapperToScreen() {\r\n\tsb_windowTools.updateDimensions();\r\n\tvar div = document.getElementById('wrapper'); \r\n\tdiv.style.width = sb_windowTools.pageDimensions.windowWidth() + 'px';\r\n\tdiv.style.height = sb_windowTools.pageDimensions.windowHeight() + 'px';\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>Again, this should be done with elastic techniques. You could skip all of this and get a better effect with the following CSS:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: css; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n#wrapper {\r\n\twidth: 100%;\r\n\theight: 100%;\r\n}\r\n</pre>\n<p>If you needed to support other browsers there would probably be some extra issues, but I believe these should work fine in WebKit. If you are having a problem with your content pushing out the div just add <code>overflow: hidden;</code> or <code>overflow: scroll;</code>.</p>\n"
