It has also been known to cause issues with page layouts because of the extra markup it adds to the page.

I&#8217;ll check it out the next time I&#8217;m looking at social widgets.</p>\n"

I have never heard of LSOs before but that is a very nasty and clever hack by AddThis, so now I understand why some pages with their button crash people&#8217;s browsers&#8230; Flash loads for no good reason.  Another sharing service that doesn&#8217;t use Flash cookies is AddToAny, which I started using on all our blogs.  I like the look and feel of it better.  There are also some open source alternatives that work well but can be difficult to keep up to date&#8230;.  Maybe for those tinfoil hat wearers!</p>\n"
