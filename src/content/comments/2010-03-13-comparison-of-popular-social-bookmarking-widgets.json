If your site serves a particular niche then it should be easy to identify the social media sites that you need to target. Just put up a couple icons and links. This will make your site load faster and make it easier to follow your presence on those social media sites. If someone wants to link your site on a social media service then not having a widget will not stop them.</p>\n"

We often perform poorly on speed tests because they aren’t done with the widget in cache, but we reach over 400 million users, so in real world situations this is rarely the case.

			"rendered": "<p><strong>@Pat</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for getting in contact with me. I&#8217;ve acquired some good information about AddToAny from you. I&#8217;ve update the article to fix the original errors.</p>\n<p><strong>@Justin</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks for checking out my article. It&#8217;s really helpful for me to get your input on these tests, and I&#8217;m sure anyone who reads this will be glad to see you responding to the comparisons and pointing out featured which I failed to mention.</p>\n<p><em>> I think one vector for comparison that I’d love to see added to your<br />\n> analysis is which actually drives the most shares. In the end, isn’t<br />\n> that the whole point?</em></p>\n<p>Indeed, I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more, and this is something I am trying to organize.</p>\n<p>However, this is a much more difficult, time-intensive and generally less-quantifiable test. Putting the different widgets on different sites and comparing page views to shares isn&#8217;t a good test alone because different sites have different types of viewers who may be more, or less, inclined to share, they have different layouts, which may be better designed to focus users on the sharing tools and different locales, which also greatly effects shares.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that young people in east, and south-east Asia are at least 50% more likely to share via a widget then the same age group in the United States. So audience makes a <em>huge</em> difference.</p>\n<p>What I am hoping to do is arrange a test on one site with lots of traffic and a varied audience (I have a test case in mind). But this test will take a <em>very</em> long time, I would need at least one month for each widget to get any kind of valid numbers. Four widgets will require four months. And that is only if I can get it approved.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to try to push forward with this because it really is the single most important metric, and is completely missing from this review. But don&#8217;t expect to see this test anytime soon.</p>\n<p><em>> according to comScore, we reach 656 million people per month worldwide.<br />\n> This means that the majority of Web visitors already have our assets<br />\n> cached on their computers</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, I made a note of that in the test metric descriptions as well. In a fully cached state all of the requests will return a 304 and not require a download.</p>\n<p>The primary focus of this test was raw performance without the benefit of cache. But it is worth pointing out that in the real world the resources for both AddThis and ShareThis are very likely to be cached due to their prolific adoption.</p>\n<p><em>> One feature that we have that you mentioned for some of the others is<br />\n> that we do auto-personalize the services listed in the menu based on<br />\n> your previous sharing history</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll add a note about that.</p>\n<p><em>> Oh oh and did you see our recent addition of clickback analytics that<br />\n> we’re providing?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, this is a great feature. I&#8217;ll add a mention about this as well.</p>\n<p><em>> A note on flash cookies… they were a legacy system that came over from<br />\n> our original flash widget platform Launchpad. After a lot of<br />\n> discussion internally and with our user community, we’re going to be<br />\n> moving to a traditional browser cookie.</em></p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how happy I am to hear this. This was a dirty tactic that I did not agree with at all. Please let me know when you take it out and I&#8217;ll update the article.</p>\n"

Wish you were there.</p>\n<p>@Steven, thanks so much for the really detailed analysis.  Our team has been going through what you wrote point by point looking at the different ways that we can improve.  We love the feedback.</p>\n<p>I think one vector for comparison that I&#8217;d love to see added to your analysis is which actually drives the most shares.  In the end, isn&#8217;t that the whole point?  We&#8217;re here to get your content shared to every corner of the Social Web.  We&#8217;ve tested every pixel of our interface to make sure that we can do that as best as possible.</p>\n<p>In terms of performance, one thing to take into consideration is that, according to comScore, we reach 656 million people per month worldwide.  This means that the majority of Web visitors already have our assets cached on their computers and won&#8217;t have to grab the whole load. </p>\n<p>Additionally, if there is an extra concern about performance, we have the ability for someone to locally serve up the main AddThis JS. &#8211; <a href=\"http://addthis.com/help/code-caching\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://addthis.com/help/code-caching</a></p>\n<p>One feature that we have that you mentioned for some of the others is that we do auto-personalize the services listed in the menu based on your previous sharing history and browser locale.  We currently support over 230 services (<a href=\"http://addthis.com/services\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://addthis.com/services</a>) and have been working to successfully show the right services to the right person at the right time. &#8211; <a href=\"http://addthis.com/features#smartest\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://addthis.com/features#smartest</a></p>\n<p>Oh oh and did you see our recent addition of clickback analytics that we&#8217;re providing?  This is a REALLY cool feature and will be able to show the ROI on the shares that you&#8217;re getting.<br />\n<a href=\"http://addthis.com/blog/2010/03/11/clickback-analytics-measure-traffic-back-to-your-site-from-addthis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://addthis.com/blog/2010/03/11/clickback-analytics-measure-traffic-back-to-your-site-from-addthis/</a></p>\n<p>A note on flash cookies&#8230; they were a legacy system that came over from our original flash widget platform Launchpad.  After a lot of discussion internally and with our user community, we&#8217;re going to be moving to a traditional browser cookie.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re also going to be exposing menu DOM events that you could attach Omniture callbacks to.  This is phase 1 of our Omniture integration.  </p>\n<p>Both of these updates will be coming, very soon so stay tuned.</p>\n<p>Again, we greatly appreciate the feedback.
