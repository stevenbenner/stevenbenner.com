These guys just love gears, gizmos, widgets and thingees, and in the end are very polished syntax welders with a knack for novelty and could not care less if the project ever is completed. They just want to make stuff.</p>\n<p>The Control Freak: They leave zero rem statements, and make unnecessary and obscure blocks of code that require them to be always involved. Job protectionists.</p>\n<p>Obfuscators: They want to disguise and confuse so nobody but them and Spock can decypher their gibberish. They win the award for the shortest variable names and most obscure Unicode separator characters that require google searches to re-use.</p>\n<p>The Abstract Artist (Code Encrypter): Nothing is clear, everything is fragmented, and it takes an enormous amount of brain ram to hold the entire flow in your head for even the simplest tasks. They turn a simple variable assignment into 4 subs, 3 properties and 2 function calls.</p>\n<p>The Bleeding Edge Adrenaline Coder: These guys never stick with a trend, always abandoning them for the newest trend they snarfed off the web. These bandwagon athletes are always so far ahead of the curve that they never have time to actually code.</p>\n<p>The NonCoder: These people were somehow mistakenly provided access to development tools, and probably should have stayed in the HR department. </p>\n<p>** SUBTYPES **<br />\nThere are also some Sub Types which all main types can exhibit:</p>\n<p>Bad Namers: These guys name the Billing module library &#8220;class hj$d2.package.ver2.kentuckyLIVE.dave&#8221; or the AccountNumber variable blueBox4</p>\n<p>Contradictors: They frequently violate their own patterns, naming schemes, styles, etc. You can never &#8220;learn&#8221; their coding approach and each team co-authoring is a dangerous syntax safari.</p>\n<p>Non/Bad Remmers: They leave no trails, notes, scraps or even rem headings for their code, even for themselves. Anyone inheriting their code will usually end up scrapping and re-writing it all after screaming expletives until they are hoarse.</p>\n"

They get into programming for the pay, or the &#8220;glory&#8221; or some other reason. These types lack the ability to think logically, problem solving ability, or understand how a computer really works. One of these &#8220;programmers&#8221; even admitted he did not have the skills when the company I was working for finally released these types of programmers. These people stumble along for years and play at programming. They only survive on the skill and kindness of others. One of the tricks they use is almost always asking questions of others either in private or in meetings. They very seldom answer any questions asked by others.</p>\n<p>These type of &#8220;programmers&#8221; may not be real programmers at all. Only actors playing the role of a programmer.</p>\n"

The effect on code economy is the same where by ten lines or their code might be worth only one line from a respectable programmer. The key difference is that the bloat appears to be the intention of the bloater rather than a side effect or by product.</p>\n<p>Bloater have some tale tail signatures. For example, they may show a reasonable skill level in handling loops and arrays in some areas yet unroll in many areas and to extremes where you have hundreds of lines where the same could have been done in dozens.

			"rendered": "<p>Well i am a anti programmer programmer.. i mean i can code but i don&#8217;t like to invent the wheel all over again. I like using frameworks to cut down on the code as much as possible. I don&#8217;t have perverted need of coding everything :) I also like visual developer tools where i can drag and drop and build interfaces and control the different components in a easy way. I&#8217;m more of a top -&gt; down programmer and not the other way around.. i know some programmers that can go for weeks/months without even seeing any visual result of their code.. i couldn&#8217;t do that. With the tools that are available for us today you can&#8217;t really say that the anti programmer is much more slower then any other programmer. The code generators and so on are getting better and better making the code really good and also easy to handle if you need to go deeper. As an anti programmer you still need to understand the basics about programming.. there is no way around that. </p>\n<p>The time we get to make apps today are getting less and less so you need to cut down on your developing time. The anti programmer has a chance of getting ahead here.. but that will only work if he doesn&#8217;t reject coding all together.. the trick is to know what you need to put an effort into coding your self and what features or functions that doesn&#8217;t need any special coding from your part and where you can use frameworks or other helpful tools.</p>\n"

So, I&#8217;m somewhere among those three. One more thing that I&#8217;ve noticed is no matter how perfectionist you think of yourself, the other guys will always make you feel that you are the worst programmer ever. Not that they are bad programmer or are wrong, and not that my programming is bad but I think its just a difference in the way people think, and the style of coding. The perfect programming is a holy grail and is context-sensitive. If you love design patterns, and your colleagues happen to be C hackers, and love AWK, you are now not a perfectionist but the dumbest in the group who can do other than refactoring a class into multiple classes, and making things complex.</p>\n"

When a modification on duct tape code is needed, you need the author. If you don&#8217;t assign the author to the task, it is likely to introduce a bug or extend the development time. This simple strategy can be very rewarding for a developer when there&#8217;s no auditing of code deliverables.</p>\n<p>From a pure software engineering perspective, duct taping code is killing collaboration by injecting author dependency.

He does not care about OO or functional programming or any other methodology. The whole feature is managed by one big source file when possible with a single main function. Implementing a new feature means seeking for a similar feature make a copy of it, changing few lines so that it works. Ideal for implementing huge list of similar business logics for an already existing application, easy to plan (he works linearly). The result is not maintainable not extendible, but fits to the actual requirements.<br />\n&#8212;<br />\nMissing the spagetti-code programmer. He likes quick solutions as the duct tape programmer, however missing the overview and the ability to make abstractions (or does not care to make efforts simplifying things). His code is as complex as can be and it will be more and more complex with every defect fix or every new feature. He might be a brilliant guy who can keep in mind a large dependency graph.

But manager knows best, and he will be rewarded, and you&#8217;ll have consistently short deadlines. Which will make you prone to lie about what are your doing, and what are the realistic estimates.

If you notice being disturbed by the nice new development tools, using more and more only paper and pencil always wondering why that particular programming language is not capable to do simple things that you already write on paper than it is a good sign being a theoretical programmer. Looking at your code in different projects it tends to be quite similar regardless of the programming language used. Another sure sign being a theoretical programmer is spending at least 90% of your time on designing, implementing generic algorithms or configurable frameworks and the required business logic comes only afterwards. It is a total nightmare to the boss who wants to see how the project approaches to the completeness. The only help is a clear and strict deadline.</p>\n"

I won&#8217;t send code to a potential employer. I assume that any such request has no other purpose than to take the person&#8217;s work and not pay them for it.</p>\n<p>In reference to the Bastard programmer, sound like a greedy rich person. Doesn&#8217;t want to give extra, but demands those extras from others.</p>\n<p>In reference to the procedural programmer. That&#8217;s a good policy to have if you are doing contract work. Otherwise, you will end up working for six months while only being paid for one.</p>\n<p>The only job I had was for a guy who said he wanted X, Y and Z in the program. OK, no problem. I hadn&#8217;t finished with the first function before he was asking for more functionality in the program. He wouldn&#8217;t wait until I had the basics of the thing up and running. </p>\n<p>Then he began to complained about how long it was taking. </p>\n<p>The more you want the longer it takes. Duh!</p>\n<p>He also specifically stated that he did not want to pay for research.<br />\nThe final rub was that every five minutes he asked me: How is it coming?<br />\nHe had a very unrealistic view of what is involved with writing a program from scratch.</p>\n<p>Sub Mode 1 &#8211; Duct tap just get the thing working.<br />\nSub Mode 2 &#8211; Perfectionist. Refine code and get rid of needless duplications.<br />\nMaster Mode &#8211; Leave me alone and don&#8217;t interrupt. If you do, it will take me five minutes to get my train of thought back. That&#8217;s five minutes if the process I&#8217;m working on is simple. Longer if the process is complex. Regardless of how long it does take me to get my train of thought back, you are paying for it, not me. And most important of all. How fast you could write the code and the fact that your salesman claimed the program will be available by such and such a time is completely irrelevant. I&#8217;m not you, I&#8217;m not the Flash and I most certainly am not Superman.Stupid promises and unrealistic expectations on your part does not mean super human ability on my part. II am just simple little methodical me. The job will get done in the time it takes me to get it done. It won&#8217;t take longer, and it can be faster.</p>\n<p>Nothing personal, it&#8217;s just that I am neither machine nor slave. And if Employer isists on treating me as such, my base ball bat will want to kiss Employer&#8217;s knee.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t have an issue with employers. Just people in general. ;-)<br />\nOH, did I mention I happen to be honest to a fault?</p>\n"
