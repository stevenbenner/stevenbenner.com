Unfortunately in too many corporations the first interview is conducted by juniors fresh out of college and still remember each line of whichever computer language manual they&#8217;ve read. I&#8217;ve lost count of the numbers of languages I&#8217;ve developed in in my career that spans 30 years of development. When I recruit, I tend to ask questions that probe whether I can work with the guy or gal and how they will behave in the team. Hard code technical skills is absolutely secondary. When I started this game there were not that many computer science graduates, we had to recruit graduates majoring in other disciplines. The fact that some of the best developer I know are English and History majors tells me something.</p>\n"

There is a lot of arrogance in computer science, lots of critics, and lots of egos battling it out. Nobody knows as much as they think they do, and, as most people can relate to, with every passing year it is easy to look back and scoff at how little your old self knew!</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s an infinite amount of things that can be learned, and an infinite number of specialties.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it boils down to this.</p>\n<p>If I was hiring, I&#8217;d look for these qualities:<br />\n1. *Humility* &#8211; Egos are a barrier to learning and writing good code, as well as collaborating with others.<br />\n2. *Enthusasism* &#8211; Without enthusiasm, you&#8217;ll get lazy, lose interest, and writing good code is very difficult if you&#8217;re not enthusiastic about programming, and learning. Companies should be particularly careful not to quell the enthusiasm of its programmers. Critics and perfectionism can stifle enthusiasm very quickly.<br />\n3. *Pragmatism* &#8211; People often get caught up in writing &#8216;perfect&#8217; code, or nit picking other people&#8217;s code, which is really a function of their ego. They feel if they release anything not perfect, they&#8217;ll be criticized, and their ego can&#8217;t take that. GOOD CODE doesn&#8217;t need to be PERFECT.</p>\n"

If he&#8217;s happy to share what he&#8217;s done because he finds his discovery intriguing (with a realistic assessment of his contribution in proportion with the grand scheme of the universe and human existence &#8212; and I&#8217;m not talking about eager-to-please brown nosers who also fail) then you&#8217;ve got someone who is interested in helping improve the situation, instead of flashing his peepee around the office, which no one cares about (expect for maybe a few idiot groupies). </p>\n<p>I came across a company you might want to slam a bit while googling around. Actually two, but one is a subsidiary I believe. D. E. Shaw Group, and D. E. Shaw Research. They ask for things like GPA or SAT scores and brag about having demanding standards,  which made me chuckle and sigh. </p>\n<p>It does well to remember that programming is a trade, a practical discipline in the practical service of something. And like anything, it does well to wrestle personal thought and experience with tradition.</p>\n"

			"rendered": "<p>A great read; thanks for posting this!  I have a lot of thoughts on this, but in short, I think I disagree slightly.  To me, you definitely have to be WILLING to learn at all times, but I don&#8217;t think it has to be your driver.  For instance, I have a developer who is worth his weight in gold, but his excellence comes in taking his existing toolset and leveraging the heck out of it.  He works best when someone else is feeding him new ideas and technology, and I don&#8217;t fault him for it.</p>\n<p>I think your article got closest to my view when you quoted Confucious:  “Real knowledge is to know the extent of ones ignorance”.  I may be biased based on my experience (aren&#8217;t we all), but to me, two major marks of a real programmer are being able to (a) accurately judge how well you understand something, and (b) know when you&#8217;re making assumptions (assumptions aren&#8217;t bad, just important to note and verify).  I also think that&#8217;s why (as the article references) some people think memorization is key: they&#8217;ve inverting a quality of the worst programmers to find the best, and the worst programmers don&#8217;t REALIZE they&#8217;re forgetting things.  In essence, I think it&#8217;s more about good (and speedy) self-reflection than a drive to learn.</p>\n<p>Thanks again!</p>\n"

A true programmer should always want to learn more and never think that their way is the only way.  My personal pet peeve is the developer that thinks they know everything there is to know and can&#8217;t find room in their mind for another&#8217;s way of doing things.  There&#8217;s a place for developers like that &#8211; a college campus &#8211; a beautiful place where they can discuss theory all day and not have to deal with real world situations.</p>\n"

I agree 100%.</p>\n<p>However some standard skills are a must &#8211; For eg, if a person has worked on relational db before (and I assume most have) I just really want to see some query writing skills. You can definitely build a working software without writing good queries, but more often than not, you end up writing more code, or more difficult to maintain code. </p>\n<p>By same analogy, if you have worked on a particular framework, then I expect you to remember the basics of &#8216;that&#8217; framework at least. Googling up something new is fine, but I expect sufficient memory to avoid googling &#8216;every time&#8217;.

Instead RethinkDB should give each interviewer a few articles or a few chapters of a book to help them get familiar with a given topic, this can be high-level coding, a business case, or some extreme low level coding.  Then in the interview they can exchange algorithms, ideas, or outcomes based on the content that was given out.  That should give them ideas on a few things, such as, how well the person understood the topic, whether they can expand on the material, or whether they can even critique a given approach by reflecting on their experience. </p>\n<p>It&#8217;s completely stupid and a waste of time to have a set of random questions in an interview process.  Anyone can ask someone an easy question that the other person wouldn&#8217;t know.  At my work, we&#8217;re constantly bombarded to find solutions to business problems that haven&#8217;t been solved before.  At first, there are always blanks in the room, but after some investigation and research we come up with great new approaches to handle each situation.

I know I can speak for many programmers when I say that I cannot wait for Monday mornings to go to work/play? My days go by so quickly I often wonder where they went. I get so engrossed in my work that I have to use Outlook&#8217;s reminder feature to help me remember when it is time to go home. (I also have a family life) I do realize how blessed I am to have a job I truly love.<br />\nI often use Google but mainly as a guide to help me research what I need from the framework or to point me in the right direction.I seldom use other people&#8217;s code and will almost always come up with my own algorithms so that I can learn from the experience.<br />\nWhen time permits I also try to help others on Forums. I thus, get exposed to particular problems I would never experience where I work.<br />\nMy point of view is that, I believe that If you love programming and have an inquisitive mind you are likely to become a great programmer. No that I view myself as one since I feel that I still have a lot to learn. This is a life long process.</p>\n"

An employable programmer cannot get by looking everything up &#8211; they need to know the programming language/paradigm they&#8217;re working with. It isn&#8217;t even possible to look everything up. If they don&#8217;t already know about a design pattern, they&#8217;re not going to think to use it. But, at the same time there is no need to memorise every detail. If they know when to use a design pattern but are unclear on its intricacies then there is no harm in looking it up. As you say, the skill of being able to seek answers and learn is a vital skill. </p>\n<p>I teach introductory Java programming to CS students and an important step is getting them to learn how to use the tools available to them to look up answers to their own questions. It is impossible to know the entire standard Java API, but knowing how to use the JavaDoc effectively means there&#8217;s no need to. Obviously, with time much of it seeps into memory and this is why we rate experience so highly in our field.</p>\n"

			"rendered": "<p>When I read this article, I had mixed feelings. Conceptually I agreed, but was troubled by your examples. I am not a CS graduate, I moved from Electronics to C/C++ programming 20 years back. Therefore, I don&#8217;t have any classroom training in algorithms and data structures. But I learned stuff from books whenever I needed them. I never studied any CS stuff I didn&#8217;t use at work.</p>\n<p>Therefore I am wary of CS pundits in high towers trying to judge who are real programmers with their high standard goggles. I still program in C++ and enjoy doing it. So I must be doing something right despite my CS ignorance.</p>\n<p>I am also sick of companies who interviewers want you to move mountains or solve world hunger or design a compiler. Especially when the company in question has no contract to move any mountain, solve world hunger or deliver a one man designed compiler.</p>\n<p>But the Google dependency is a red flag for me. Looking up the Internet for help in debugging a problem, or how to use a particular API is one thing. But looking up the Internet on how to code a common enough algorithm is something else. </p>\n<p>My uncle is retired doctor and he tells me that there is a major difference between his generation of doctors and the current generation. His generation of doctors could do clinical diagnosis of most cases without any gadgets or tests. They would prescribe tests only when they are not very sure. But the current generation of doctors are completely dependent on lab tests and gadgets. Yes, they would also need these tests as defense against malpractice suits. As a result, the clinical diagnosis is becoming a lost art. Why bother trying to diagnose when the tests can tell you in writing.</p>\n<p>I have seen similar thing happening in the programming world ever since Java came into being 1995. It was the first major language that lowered the entry barrier into the programming job. I am not saying it is a bad thing. Most programming jobs are not rocket science, you don&#8217;t need a CS graduate to render a sales report onto the browser by querying into the database. Advent of easier languages like Java/C# has made it easy for coding such requirements. But you do need a programmer with decent understanding of CS to design a browser or a database itself. Firefox or MySQL was not designed by somebody who didn&#8217;t have understanding of CS. Therefore, if somebody is looking for programmers with understanding of CS, we have no business poopooing their requirements without knowing their coding needs.</p>\n<p>A programmer who can code without Google, can be even more potent with Google. A hell of a lot better than the programmer who is helpless without Google. If this is the kind of programmer you need, then you have to look for them, nothing less will do. </p>\n<p>After reading this article, I looked up the blog article by Slava. And I am fully with him. A link list is one of the simplest DS out there. Even a non-CS grunt like me could instantly think of how to code a C function to reverse a link list in my mind. Even the rest of the problems looked reasonable and anybody with CS background should find it easy. I empathize with him because I too reject 100s CS candidates each year who couldn&#8217;t code a C function to replace a character in a string. It is really scary.  </p>\n<p>The truth is that the art of programming is getting lost just like the art of clinical diagnosis. And lots of people think it is okay.</p>\n"

If it is for C-programming, okay, you have a point, but e.g. a lisper can basically solve this problem using (reverse) and its brothers. The building blocks here are just different. I won&#8217;t ask a mason if he knows how to make his bricks, it&#8217;s enough if he knows how to select the right one.</p>\n<p>And how would you go about testing critical thinking?</p>\n"

I&#8217;ve made things happen that people have told me cannot be done.  In fact, I&#8217;d say it is now a speciality of mine.

			"rendered": "<p>I do generally agree with you except for a couple of caveats:</p>\n<p> &#8211; 99/100 not passing the interview may be reasonable if you have a need for a very specific skill set and not just another programmer who will become great. Consider if you were working on an embedded multithreaded kernel and a programmer shows good abilities to work through a generic problem. This could be a great programmer for your organization in enough time, but with deadlines, you do need someone who had a concept of multithreaded or working at a low level. Most teams are not like that though.</p>\n<p> &#8211; I support conceptually googling but while in an office. This is especially important for larger companies or a question of team skills. Being able to look something up is useful most of the time, but a lot of large companies might have a large amount of proprietary infrastructure already in place that the internet will not tell someone about (alternatively you can consider intellectual property questions about the use of code provided by someone on the internet going into a product). What seems like a good strategy is prefacing a difficult question or ambiguous question with the statement that questions are very encouraged and the interviewer is more interested in your thoughts than the correct answer. Working through a problem with an interviewee can really show how well they can open up with a challenge and whether or not they can consider different approaches when suggested.</p>\n<p> &#8211; I would argue that law still takes learning. How about mopping floors?</p>\n<p>Good article</p>\n"
